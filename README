Ben's notes:

Forked Carl's repo, and it sort of worked out of the box. Tweaked for: 

 - Downloading 12.04 final release. (Today as of this writing)
 - Checking MD5 to make sure it is the right version
 - Added a few more checks for external dependencies, mkisofs
 - Removed wget, and used curl to reduce dependencies
 - Added more output to see what is going on

Decided I wanted to learn how to make a vagrant base box.

Let's target Precise Pangolin since it should be releasing soon, I said.

Let's automate everything, I said.

Let's do it all on my macbook, I said.

Woo.
